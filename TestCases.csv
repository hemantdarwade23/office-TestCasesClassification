Dear Applicant,
Welcome to the onboarding of a new AIF investment with MO AMC. Before you begin your application process, here are a few things we would like you to know and understand.
This is an online onboarding of an AIF investment. You will be required to complete the Applicant(s) personal and investment details across multiple sections:
As part of this process, the application will fetch your KYC (Know Your Customer) details and documents submitted as part of your KYC verification through CVL KRA (Link - https://www.cvlkra.com/ ) (KYC Registration Agency).
Prior to submission of the application form, you will be required to electronically sign the form using your Aadhaar Number and OTP. To know more about this process, click here. (Link - https://www.egov-nsdl.co.in/e-sign.html )
If you are completing a joint application, you are asked to complete the onboarding details of each Applicant, one after another, by repeating the process. However, each Applicant will be required to individually electronically sign the completed application using their respective Aadhaar numbers and OTP.
For each holder, the application process is expected to take between 12-15 minutes. You can also partially fill the application and continue with the rest of the application at a later time. Post completing the application, each Applicant will need to complete a set of steps to finalise the application:
Upload their photo & signature
E-sign the application form using Aadhaar number & OTP
If you require any support during this process, you can call us at +91 8108622211 or email us at customerservice@MOamc.com",Positive
